    <h1> The Ingleton Barber </h1>
    A logic puzzle by <b>Brandon Bennett</b>
    <p>

        Your problem is to use <i>first-order logic (with equality)</i> to represent the following example of reasoning, and use the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the reasoning is valid.
        <p>
            Use the following template file to create your Prover9 encoding of the problem:
            <font size="+1">
                <a href="ingleton_barber.p9"><b><tt>ingleton_barber.p9</tt></b></a>
            </font>
            <p>
                <b>Marks: </b>There are two marks for each sentence, making a total of <b>12</b> marks.

                <p><b>Outline: </b> This puzzle concerns an inconsistent barber from Ingleton and a pink dog that ate my homework. <br> Ingleton is a village in the Yorkshire Dales, famous for its beautiful
                    <i>waterfalls walk</i>. But if you want to get your hair cut in Ingleton you will end up in tangles.*<br> You may be surprised that logical reasoning can lead to unexpected consequences.
