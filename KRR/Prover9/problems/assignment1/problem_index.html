<H2> KRR Assignment 1 (Autumn 2021) </H2>

The aim of this assignment is to encode reasoning problems stated in English into classical logic. <b>Prover9</b> should used to edit and test the representations. The required submission consists of Prover9 input files that are to be submitted to Gradescope.
<ul>
    <li>There are three problems, one should be encoded in
        <i>propositional</i> logic and the other two require
        <i>first-order-logic</i> (with equality). Links to the problems are below.
        <li>More information on using Prover9 can be found on my
            <a href=https://teaching.bb-ai.net/KRR/Prover9/info.html>
    Prover9 exercises information</a> web page.

            <li>The Gradescope submission link will not be available until a few days before the deadline. You will receive an announcement when it becomes available.
