    <h1> Honey Crumpets </h1>
    A logic problem by <b>Brandon Bennett</b>
    <p>

        Your problem is to use <i>first-order logic</i> to represent the following example of reasoning, and use the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the reasoning is valid.
        <p>
            Use the following template file to create your Prover9 encoding of the problem:
            <font size="+1">
                <a href="honey_crumpets.p9"><b><tt>honey_crumpets.p9</tt></b></a>
            </font>
            <p>

                <p><b>Outline: </b>I have four crumpets on a plate. Two are honey crumpets and the other two just butter. I can eat two crumpets but must leave two for my freind. Of course, I want to have at least one of the Honey crumpets. But unfortunately,
                    the warm honey has run into the crumpets, and I cannot tell, or remember, which are the honey ones. However, I do remember that the two honey crumpets were next to each other. Is there a way to take two and be sure that I get a honey
                    crumpet?
                    <p>
                        <b>Domain:</b> You should take the <i>domain of quantification</i> to be the set of crumpets on the plate.
