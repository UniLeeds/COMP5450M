    <h1> Parts and Overlaps </h1>
    A logic problem by <b>Adam Richard-Bollans</b>
    <p>

        Your problem is to use <i>first-order logic</i> to represent the following example of reasoning, and use the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the reasoning is valid.
        <p>
            Use the following template file to create your Prover9 encoding of the problem:
            <font size="+1">
                <a href="parts_and_overlaps.p9"><b><tt>parts_and_overlaps.p9</tt></b></a>
            </font>
            <p>
