<H2>Propositional Logic Exercises for Prover9</H2>
This is a set of formative exercises designed to teach you the skills of encoding problems into propositional logic representation and solving them using an automated theorem prover.
<p>
    Note that what is called <i>propositional logic</i> is a logical language that only has propositional letter symbols (representing atomic statements that are either true or false) and truth-functional connectives.
