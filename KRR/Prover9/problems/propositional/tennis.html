    <h1> The Tennis Lover </h1>
    Stolen from an anonymous worksheet, posted on the web at University of California Irvine, which says that it comes from an advert for a tennis magazine.
    <p>

        Your problem is to use <i>propositional logic</i> to represent the following example of reasoning, and use the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the reasoning is valid.
        <p>
            Use the following template file to create your Prover9 encoding of the problem:
            <font size="+1">
                <a href="tennis.p9"><b><tt>tennis.p9</tt></b></a>
            </font>
            <p>
                <b>Marks: </b>There are two marks for each sentence, making a total of <b>8</b> marks.

                <p><b>Outline: </b>This problem is a bit different from most of the others ones. Rather than being given a specific goal, you need to find an appropriate goal, which both answers the question and is provable from the assumptions. You should
                    try possible goals one at a time, until you find one that is provable. Alternatively, you could work out the goal by your own reasoning and then check it using Prover9. Of course, if you have represented the other sentences incorrectly,
                    the correct goal may not be provable, and possibly a different goal could be provable. So you may need to check and alter the other formulae to get a proof of the correct goal.

                                of a specific answer that we want.</li>
