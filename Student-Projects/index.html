            This page gives an overview of possible project topic areas that I would like to supervise for final year undergraduates and taught Masters students. I can be quite flexible in the specific details of the project scope and objectives and would also consider
            other areas that relate to my broad interests in Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation.
            <p>
                For students doing projects, some additional resources can be found

The  aim  of this  project  is  to  investigate the  use  of
qualitative   spatial  representation   and   reasoning  for
simulating  the  movement  of  intelligent  agents,  and  to
develop   prototype   software   which  simulates   movement
behaviour in a simple context.
<p>
Qualitative spatial relations  correspond to properties such
as  "x is touching  y" or  "z is  to the  left of  w", which
describe spatial configurations  in a high-level, similar to
that we use in natural language.  Many AI researchers belive
that  utilising such  representations  instead of  low-level
coordinate geometry,  may be a key  to achieving intelligent
movement behaviour.

                                                                                                                                both denote sets of objects. Under this interpretation, the combination of a noun and an adjective simply denotes the intersection

One observation is that many adjectives come in <i>polar opposite</i>                                                                                                                                    pairs --- for example: <b><i>hot</i></b> <i>vs.</i> <b><i>cold</i></b>,

Informally, an ecological niche characterises the places in which a species can live in terms of the kinds of environment to which it is

An early, but still widely used model is to regard the ecological niche as a hyper-cube within a space of environmental parameters. The area within the cube represents the range of livable

<h3>BB-CalVis: 3D Calendar Visualisation</h3>

Calendars   and  timetables   are  usually   presented  in   the  form   of  a
two-dimensional  grid. Although  this representation  is easy  to  display, it
bears little relation  to the actual structure of time  and is not well-suited
to  indicating  the relative  importance  and  relationship between  different
events.
<p>
The  aim  of  this project  is  to  explore  other  ways to  present  calendar
information which might give a more vivid impression of time and events.

My  hypothesis   is  that,  rather  than   using  a  grid,   a  better  visual
representation would  be to present time  as a PATH, stretching  away into the
future. In  order to achieve this,  the calendar would be  constructed using 3D
graphics so that  events in the near  future are seen as closer  than those in
the  distant  future.   (This   would  not  necessarily  require  particularly
elaborate 3D  graphics, since  the idea could  be realised with  fairly simple
scaling of icons and/or text.)
<p>
The relative importance  of events could also be represented  by size, so that
certain events would be easily visible  even though they are relatively far in
the future. Care would  need to be taken to ensure that  the distance and size
of an event icon  do not get mixed up; but this  should be possible, since the
distance/time  to  an  event  would  be  indicated  by  its  position  on  the
3-dimensional  display of  the  time PATH,  which  would get  narrower in  the
distance.
<p>
Within this general idea, a wide variety of calendar displays are possible.  I
suggest that project should focus  on developing one style of visualisation but
also allow certain features of the  display (such as scaling parameters) to be
modified. This will enable evaluation of  what type of view is most accessible
and intuitive for  calendar users. Evaluation of the  system will also require
comparing the  ease of  comprehension of the  new calendar  visualisation with
that of traditional grid-style calendars.
<p>
The project would require competence in programming.

<h3>Perception of Barely Discernible Colour Differences</h3>

<b>Project code:</b> BB-PBDCD<br>
<b>Improbable supervisor:</b> Brandon Bennett <br> 
<b>Types of project:</b> Exploratory Software or Empirical Investigation<br>
<b>Area of Interest:</b> Perception and Cognition<br>
<b>Appropriate for degree programme:</b> Any<br>

<b>Multiple projects can be considered: </b>Yes<br>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> Programming Skills (e.g. Java, Python)<br>  


If  two colours  are close  enough  in shade  and hue,  a human  cannot
distinguish them.  However, a series  of indistinguishable differences
will eventually lead to a difference that is distinguishable.
<p>
By comparing two indistinguishable samples  to a third they may become
distinguishable.
<p>
It seems  that by means  of indirect comparison and  reasoning, humans
can   distinguish  differences   that   cannot  be   made  by   direct
perception. However, as yet hardly any experiments have been conducted
to examine the conditions under which this can occur.
<p>
The goal is to produce a piece of software that can be used to conduct
colour perception experiments  and to try it out  on some guinea-pigs
(i.e. human test subjects of suitably docile temperament).
A relatively  simple GUI should  be sufficient, which can  show colour
samples   in   various  configurations   and   sequences  and   record
choices/observations made by users.
<p>
The software should support experiments such as the following:
<ol>
<li> Show pairs of similar colour  samples and ask the user to say which
is lighter/darker or whether they are the same.
<li>
Display a scrambled sequence of say 10 similar colour samples which
vary continuously in shade and  ask the user to arrange them according
to shade or hue.

<h3>BB-QUEST: Creating and Manging Structured Questionnaires</h3>

Computer-based  forms or  questionnaires are  increasingly used  for a
variety of purposes involving  information and requirements capture or
problem diagnosis.   A significant  feature of such  questionnaires is
that  there is often  a dependency  between the  answers given  at one
point  in the  question  sequence and  the  subsequent questions  that
should be  asked.  To take  a simple example,  suppose that a  user is
asked whether they own a laptop;  if they answer "yes" they might then
be asked  what model it is  or what they  use it for, whereas  if they
answer "no" these questions will be skipped.
<p>
In existing systems such dependencies are typically hard-coded so that
producing a new questionnaire  involves modification of the underlying
program. A  somewhat more sophisticated  solution is to  represent the
questionnaire as a tree of  possible questions, where each question is
a node and the different  possible answers correspond to branches from
this note. Each path through the tree then corresponds to a legitimate
sequence of questions.
<p>
Although  the  tree  model  is  very  general  it  does  have  certain
disadvantages. A typical tree will  contain a lot of repetition, since
many questions are independent of each other so the same question will
be asked  on many branches of the  tree. This means that  the tree can
become  very large even  though the  constrains between  questions are
relatively  simple. Another drawback  is that  in constructing  such a
tree,  the  questionnaire  designer  has  to commit  to  a  particular
sequence  of questions,  even when  there is  no real  reason  why one
question should  come before  another. A related  problem is  that for
large  questionnaires,  this   tree  representation  is  difficult  to
maintain and extend. Since it is not always clear whether a particular
ordering of  questions in  the tree is  necessary because  of question
dependencies  or is just  an arbitrary  choice, someone  modifying the
questionnaire structure may introduce  errors when adding, deleting or
modifying questions or possible answers.
<p>
A previous final  year project (Matthew Robertshaw 2008)  looked at an
alternative solution,  which seems to have clear  advantages over both
the hard-coded and tree-based approaches. The basic idea is to specify
only the actual dependencies among the questions without committing to
a  particular  question  ordering.   Possible orderings  can  then  be
generated  automatically  by  finding  sequences  that  satisfy  these
constraints.  In  fact,  this  can  be  done  dynamically,  while  the
questionnaire is being answered.
<p>
The previous  project will provide  a good starting point  for further
investigation but was somewhat limited in the kinds of question/answer
dependencies that could be  represented.  A desirable extension (which
would most likely  be a minimum requirement for  a further project) is
to  allow  question  choices  to  depend on  Boolean  combinations  of
previous answers.  For  example, one might want to ask  "Do you have a
home  internet question" depending  on whether  a person  has answered
"yes"  either to  the  question "Do  you  own a  laptop?"   or to  the
question "Do  you own a  desktop computer?".  In general  a constraint
could depend  on a complex  combination of possible answers  that were
given to one or more previous questions.
<p>
Rather finding a question sequence that just meets the hard dependency
constraints, a  further development would be  to look at  how the most
natural orderings  for questions  can be extracted  automatically. For
instance,  if one  question depends  on  a previous  answer, it  seems
preferable that it should be  asked soon after the question upon which
it depends. Thus  the dependencies can be used  to find user orderings
that a user is likely to find helpful.
<p>
In  implementing  such a  system  many  different  platforms could  be
suitable. There are good  reasons why a web-based implementation might
be preferable,  but in terms of  the primary project  objectives it is
the representation and processing  of questionnaire structures that is
more important. Whatever platform  is chosen the project must consider
the questionnaire both  from the point of view of  a person filling it
in and from the point of view of the designer of the questionnaire.
<p>
In evaluating the outcome of this project, the student should consider
the robustness and  flexibility of the algorithm developed  as well as
its convenience for users.

<h3>BB-TRAJ: Describing Object Trajectories in Tracked Video Data</h3>

Object tracking algorithms are one  of the main strands of research in
Computer  Vision.  Although,  there  are still  problems arising  from
factors  such  as noise,  shadows  and  occlusion,  State of  the  art
tracking  software can  achieve very  good performance  in  tracking a
variety  of different  kinds  of  object.  The  output  of a  tracking
algorithm is normally a trajectory  or set of trajectories, where each
trajectory is  given by a sequence  of bounding regions  that give the
location of a moving object at  each frame of a given video.  Although
this  kind  of  information  can  be  very useful  for  a  variety  of
applications, it is far removed  from the way that humans describe the
motion of moving objects.
<p>
The primary aim of this project  is not object tracking in itself, but
the implementation  of a mechanism for generating  descriptions of the
trajectory information output by  a tracking program. For instance, an
object may  walk, run,  fall, rise, roll,  bounce, fly, hover;  it may
travel in a straight line, a curve, a zig zag etc. Thus the goal would
be  to develop  a mechanism  that reads  in the  low  level trajectory
information  and outputs a  description of  the observed  motion using
this kind of high level vocabulary.
<p>
The exact scope  of the project can be determined  by the student. For
instance  one might  want to  achieve  a broad  coverage of  different
descriptions, but be less concerned with reliability, or one might try
to get a  more accurate description but in terms of  a narrow range of
motion descriptions.
<p>
It  will   not  be  necessary   to  develop  tracking   software  from
scratch. Such software is widely  available and fairly easy to obtain
and  run.   For  instance,  the  python-openCV   package  provides  an
accessible platform, for which quite a lot of useful code can be found
on  the  Internet.  Alternatively,   one  could  directly  obtain  the
trajectory information output from  a tracker, either from some source
on the Internet of from  members of the Computer Vision research group
here at Leeds. So it may not be necessary to use a tracker software at
all.

<h3>BB-IFT: Interactive Transformer for Structured Data Files</h3>

Many computer  applications read or  output data in  the form of  a structured
text  file.   A  wide  variety  of  such files  are  commonly  used,  encoding
information  of diverse kinds,  such as:  an address  book, a  bibliography, a
calendar, a table of statistics, a  list of events, a music playlist, an email
file, a Latex document.
<p>
Differences between formats mean that tasks which one would expect to be quick
and easy  are often  time consuming and  tedious.  For  instance, I may  use a
Latex  tabular  environmen  to  produce  a  nicely  formatted  timeble  for  a
meeting. To  then put  this on  a web-page will  involve converting  the latex
table format to an HTML table format.
<p>
The  idea of  this  project is  to  build a  convenient  interactive tool  for
transforming files  of one  format to another.   The tool should  support file
transformation  in  a general  and  flexible  way  by providing  a  re-writing
mechanism that can  specify a wide class of  possible transforms.  Moreover, a
user  should be able  to incrementally  build towards  a desired  transform by
specifying a sequence  of simpler steps and seeing the  effect that they would
produce.
<p>
In  order to  evaluate effectiveness  of  the tool,  I suggest  that tests  be
carried  out regarding  transforming among  common file  formats, such  as the
following:

<ul>
<li> CSV files.
<li> ICAL calendar format.
<li> HTML --- especially structures such as tables.
<li> Latex --- technical writing foramat.
<li> BIBTEX bibliography reference format.
<li> Email Files.
</ul>

The project would require competence in programming.
I would suggest implementation in Python or Java, although other
platforms can also be considered.

<h3>BB-Candle: Analysing and learning Japanese Candle patterns in stock and currency exchange charts</h3>

Japanese Candle charts are a way of presenting information about the changing value of financial instruments
(i.e. stocks, shares, commodities, currencies) that are bought and sold on a stock market. The chart consists of a series of
candle icons, which each describe the behaviour of the market over a fixed time period.
Each candle indicates the prices of the financial instrument at the beginning of that period and
also the high and low prices paid for the instrument during that time period. A number of different types
of candlestick can occur depending on different ways that the price may vary across the interval.
Stock analysts believe that by studying the patterns of occurrence of different types of candlestick 
one can obtain clues about what will happen to the stock price in the near future; and using these
clues one can make money out of the stock exchange.
<p>
The project would apply computational analysis and possibly machine learning techniques to find
correlations between candlestick patters and price movements.

 It may be
possible to devise a project which is mostly testing
and evaluation of different configuration setting for
existing software modules (e.g. the shot choice module). 
Such a project would require relatively little coding.
